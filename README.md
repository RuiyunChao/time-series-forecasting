This pfojdct provides a weather forecast for the first week of 2024 for the Waterloo region,
using 2023 temperature data from the University of Waterloo Weather Station. We will use
different forecast models: unregularized regression, regularized regression, smoothing, and Box
Jenkins, to make predictions and select the best model by comparing their average prediction
squared error (APSE).
